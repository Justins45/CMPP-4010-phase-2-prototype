# CMPP4010 Phase 2 Prototype

This is the prototype code for phase 2 of our semester long project... 
to get started navigate to `clinet/main.py` and `server/main.py` 
and have both scripts running to allow each other to connect and talk.

**Keep in mind** you will need to get a .venv setup for both the client 
and server side on your machine 
 
This is because we are not using Docker so the .venv will not work on 
across multiple computers, they each need to be local to our machine.
